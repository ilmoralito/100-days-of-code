Today I start my 100 days of code, it has not been easy, it has been a complex day but thank God here is the first day. Now I learned about Pre-rendering and Data Fetching in nextjs, specifically getStaticProps Details, I have a couple of doubts, first. How should I make more than one request for data using getStaticProps and second how do I assign the value to data props obtained as promises? I hope to answer this tomorrow and comment it here
